## 🧠 About the Project

The **JSON Tree Visualizer** allows users to:
- Paste or type raw JSON and visualize it as a hierarchical node tree  
- Search any key or path — highlights and centers the matched node  
- Toggle between **Dark / Light themes**  
- Download the visualization as a **high-quality PNG**  
- Includes a **Root Node** for better structural clarity  

This project is built to make JSON debugging, exploration, and documentation more intuitive for developers.
